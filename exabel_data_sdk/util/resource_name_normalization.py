    Turns the given identifiers into entity resource names.

    The name of the given series is used to determine what kind of identifier it is.
    These are the legal series names, and how each case is handled:

     - entity (or entity_from or entity_to)
        The given identifiers are the entity resource names.
        The identifiers are returned unaltered.

     - isin
        The given identifiers are ISIN numbers.
        The ISIN numbers are looked up with the Exabel API, and the Exabel resource identifiers
        for the associated companies are returned.

     - factset_identifier
        The given identifiers are FactSet IDs.
        The identifiers are looked up with the Exabel API, and the Exabel resource identifiers
        are returned.

     - bloomberg_ticker
        The given identifiers are Bloomberg tickers.
        The tickers are looked up with the Exabel API, and the Exabel resource identifiers
        are returned.

     - figi
        The given identifiers are FIGIs (Financial Instrument Global Identifiers).
        The FIGIs are looked up with the Exabel API, and the Exabel resource identifiers
        are returned.

     - mic:ticker
        The given identifiers are the combination of MIC and stock ticker, separated by a colon.
        MIC is the Market Identifier Code of the stock exchange where the stock is traded under
        the given ticker.
        The MIC/ticker combinations are looked up with the Exabel API, and the Exabel resource
        identifiers are returned.
        Examples:
            XNAS:AAPL refers to Apple, Inc. on NASDAQ
            XNYS:GE refers to General Electric Co. on the New York Stock Exchange
            XOSL:TEL refers to Telenor ASA on the Oslo Stock Exchange

     - any known entity type, e.g. "brand" or "product_type":
        The given identifiers are customer provided names.
        The names are first normalized (using the normalize_resource_name method)
        and then a full resource identifier is constructed on this form:
            entityTypes/{entityType}/entities/{namespace}.{normalized_name}
        for example:
            entityTypes/brand/entities/acme.Spring_Vine
        If the entity type is read-only, e.g. "country" or "currency", the namespace is
        not added to the resource identifier.
        For example:
            entityTypes/country/entities/I_DE

    It is also possible to override the normalisation and search with the provided
    `entity_mapping`. This is useful when the Exabel API is not able to find the corresponding
    entity for an identifier, or one wants to hard map an identifier to a specific entity.

    Returns:
        a tuple containing:
            * a Series with the same index as the input Series, where any identifier that could not
              be mapped is set to None
